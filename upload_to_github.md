# Upload Fixed Files to GitHub

## Files to Upload:

1. **`api_server.py`** - Fixed API server (no authentication)
2. **`smart_order_router.py`** - Updated with real CCXT integration
3. **`requirements.txt`** - Already has CCXT included

## Steps:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Upload these files (replace the existing ones)
3. Commit the changes
4. The changes will automatically deploy to Render

## What's Fixed:

- ✅ **No authentication required** for any API endpoints
- ✅ **Real CCXT integration** for Gate.io and MEXC
- ✅ **Prices endpoint** works without database
- ✅ **Orders endpoint** works without authentication
- ✅ **All endpoints** are now public

## Test After Upload:

1. Wait for Render to redeploy (2-3 minutes)
2. Test: `https://smart-order-router.onrender.com/health`
3. Test: `https://smart-order-router.onrender.com/prices/BTC/USDT`
4. Run your frontend: `streamlit run sor_app.py`
